          // head.style.color="red";
         //  head.style.backgroundColor="yellow";

         // 2)  // so we set all properties  to one class and latter add that class by setAttribute( )  method .

         // so it is quite tedious to set every class name line by line 
          
         // 3)  so we have .classlist property which returns us the list of all classes of any element 
         //  and by some methods we may also add any number classes to any element all at once . 
            para.classList.add("class1","class2","class3")  // there are other properties also but thjis is a best methjod of adding any css related properties from the java script.
